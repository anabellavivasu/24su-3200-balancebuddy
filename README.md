# Summer 2024 CS 3200 Project Template Repository

## About

This project explores some features of Streamlit & Flask to build a comprehensive web app, Balance Buddy. Our website aims to develop a comprehensive fitness and nutrition tracker application tailored for health-conscious individuals, fitness enthusiasts, professional trainers, and health companies.

Team Members: Eleanor Washburn, Jos√© Agramonte, Duy Quang Tran, Anabella Vivas Uzcategui, Ethan Shan.

## Current Project Components

Currently, there are three major components:
- Streamlit App (in the `./app` directory)
- Flask REST api (in the `./api` directory)
- MySQL setup files (in the `./database-files` directory)

## Getting Started for Personal Exploration
1. Clone the repo to your computer. 
2. Start the docker containers. 

## Handling User Role Access and Control

The Streamlit pages are split up among 4 roles - John, the Marketing Director of BalanceBuddy, Adam, an out-of-shape college student looking to achieve his fitness goals, Stephen, a Nutritionist, and LiveFit, company who advertises their products on BalanceBuddy.
